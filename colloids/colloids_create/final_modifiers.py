class SeedModifier(FinalModifier):
    """
    Modifier of an existing configuration in a Frame instance that seeds the configuration with particles from another
    frame.

    Particles in the base frame that overlap with the seed are removed. If such a particle is part of a constraint
    (bond), all particles in that constraint group are removed together to avoid breaking bonds.

    The overlap is determined based on the surface-to-surface distance between particles, taking into account their
    diameters. Particles are considered overlapping if their surface-to-surface distance is less than the specified
    overlap distance. Note that the surface-to-surface distance is calculated without applying periodic boundary
    conditions.

    The seed positions are taken directly from the seed frame without any transformation. The base frame's box must be
    at least as large as the seed frame's box in all dimensions. Additionally, both boxes must be orthorhombic.

    Optionally, one can filter the seed frame to keep only the largest cluster of particles before seeding. For this,
    a cutoff distance must be provided. Two particles are considered neighbors if their distance is less than this
    cutoff distance. The largest cluster is determined based on these neighbor relationships. If any particle in a bond
    belongs to the largest cluster, all particles in that bond are included in the largest cluster.

    This modifier requires that the frame already has diameter, charge, and mass attributes set. The diameters are
    needed for overlap detection.

    :param seed_filename:
        Path to the GSD file containing the seed configuration.
    :type seed_filename: str
    :param seed_frame_index:
        The frame index in the seed file to use. Negative indices are supported (e.g., -1 for last frame).
        Defaults to -1.
    :type seed_frame_index: int
    :param overlap_distance:
        The overlap tolerance for determining which particles to remove. Particles are considered overlapping if their
        surface-to-surface distance is less than this value.
        Must have units compatible with nanometers and be non-negative.
        Defaults to 0.0 nm.

    :param cluster_cutoff_distance:
        Optional maximum neighbor distance for clustering in the seed frame. If provided, only the largest cluster
        of particles in the seed frame will be used for seeding.
        Must have units compatible with nanometers.
        Must be positive if provided.
        Default is None, meaning no filtering of the seed frame.

        Modify the given configuration in-place by seeding it with particles from the seed frame.

        Particles in the base frame that overlap with the seed are removed. If such a particle is part of a constraint
        (bond), all particles in that constraint group are removed together.

        The seed positions are taken directly from the seed frame without any transformation.

        This method modifies the following attributes of the given frame:
        - frame.particles.N
        - frame.particles.position
        - frame.particles.types
        - frame.particles.typeid

            If the base frame's box is smaller than the seed frame's box in any dimension.
